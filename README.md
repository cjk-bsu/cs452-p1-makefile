# CS452 - P1 Warmup: Circular Linked List

This project is a C implementation of a classic data structure: the circular doubly linked list with a sentinel node. While a relatively simple task to implement in any standard programming language, the purpose of this project is to serve as a refresher to the C programming language, pointers, struct's, and manual memory management. This warmup kicks off the semester and gets the ball rolling towards the bigger and badder assignments to come. 

#### <u>NOTE</u>: All of the following commands must be performed in the root directory of this repository (i.e. the location of this README) in order to compile and run this program.

## Building

Before the program can be run, it needs to be compiled. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
make
```

## Testing

The tests written to assess the correct functionality of the data structure itself can be run only after the program is initially compiled. To run these tests, use the following command:

```bash
make check
```

## Clean

To remove the current build of the program, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make clean
```
<u>NOTE</u>: After running this command, the build command will have to be used again before running the tests is possible.

## Install Dependencies

In order to use git send-mail and other features, dependencies are needed.  Please run the following command to install them:

```bash
make install-deps
```

If you run into any issues with compilation, pursue this as a first attempt at troubleshooting.
